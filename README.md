# VBScript IsEmpty and Null Variant Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to the `IsEmpty` function's handling of `Null` variants.  The `IsEmpty` function returns `True` for both `Empty` and `Null` variants, which may not always be the intended behavior.  This can cause unexpected issues in functions that expect empty strings but do not handle `Null` values appropriately.

## Bug Description

The provided `bug.vbs` script showcases the problem. The `f` function intends to validate an input string, checking for emptiness, non-string types, and length. However, if the input is `Null`, `IsEmpty` returns `True`, causing the function to exit prematurely, potentially causing downstream errors.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a corrected version that explicitly checks for `Null` values using `Isnull` before using `IsEmpty` which improves the functions' robustness and reliability.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.vbs` with a `Null` argument (e.g., `call f(nothing)` ).
3. Observe the behavior.  Run `bugSolution.vbs` with the same and compare the results
4. The solution addresses the problem by explicitly checking for null values and handling them separately.
